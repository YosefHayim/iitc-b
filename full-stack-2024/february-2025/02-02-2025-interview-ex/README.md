# JavaScript Interview Challenges and Guidance

This project contains a variety of JavaScript coding challenges and interview questions that are commonly asked. Instead of providing complete solutions, each challenge file contains tips and guidelines (written as comments) to help you work through the problem. You can remove or keep these tips as you like.

## Additional Preparation Tips

- **Understand the Fundamentals:** Master basic concepts such as loops, conditionals, closures, recursion, and array/object manipulation.
- **Explain Your Thought Process:** In interviews, explaining your approach clearly is as valuable as writing correct code.
- **Plan Before Coding:** Consider edge cases and structure your code with small, testable functions.
- **Practice Debugging:** Be ready to talk through your debugging process.
- **Review New Concepts:** Beyond coding, ensure you understand asynchronous programming, hoisting, prototypal inheritance, and ES6+ features.

Happy coding and best of luck in your interviews!
