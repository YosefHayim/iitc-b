The document "QA Methodologies and System Testing Overview part B" explains different methodologies in QA automation. It covers various system types:

1. **IT Systems**: Systems managing business operations, such as ERP and CRM, which handle data and tasks like inventory or customer management.

2. **Real-Time/Embedded Systems**: Systems requiring immediate responses, like car braking systems or smart home devices.

3. **Command & Control Systems**: Critical systems used in high-stakes environments, such as military or air traffic control.

The document also outlines various testing methodologies:

1. **Functional Testing**: Ensuring the system works as expected (e.g., an app successfully completing transactions).
2. **Non-Functional Testing**: Checking performance, security, and usability (e.g., testing how well a website handles high traffic).

It highlights testing approaches such as **Monkey Testing** (random inputs to find errors) and **Boundary Testing** (testing limits of inputs).
